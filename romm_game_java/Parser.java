Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and * tries to interpret the line as a two-word command. It returns the command * as an object of class Command. * * The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against * the known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it * returns a command object that is marked as an unknown command. *  * @author   Lingkai Huang (21318909) * @version  12/11/2013 */public class Parser {     private CommandWords commands;  // holds all valid command words     /**     * Create a new Parser.     */    public Parser()     {        commands = new CommandWords();    }    /**     * Get a new command from the user.
